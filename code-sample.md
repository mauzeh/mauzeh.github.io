Thanks for being interested in my work! There are **two sample projects** available on Github that you may wish to review:
 
1. A minimal implementation of a [REST API](https://www.github.com/mauzeh/hangman-api/). This includes the API source and automated tests.
2. A selection of code from a live in-production [Workflow App](https://www.github.com/mauzeh/showcase-symfony/). This repository contains a selected set of classes including their related tests.
